                It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                China.
              </p>
              <p>
                Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
              </p>
              <p>
                Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
                with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                          People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are
                          living
                          in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the
                          disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or
                          other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a
                          nation.
                          Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to
                          blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and
                          myths.

                        <p>
                          Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead
                          of
                          the disease that is causing the problem.

                          Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                          others,
                          such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                          coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                          between
                          people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.
                          Middle
                          East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are
                          two
                          other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to
                          people.

                          This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first
                          infections
                          were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from
                          person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on
                          a
                          continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses
                          are
                          less so.

                          Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area,

                          The virus that causes COVID-19 is <a href="#">spreading from person-to-person.</a>
                          Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is
                          why
                          CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                          (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of
                          infecting others.

                        <p>
                          How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release
                          someone
                          from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors,
                          infection
                          prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering
                          specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms,
                          and
                          results of laboratory testing for that patient.

                          requirements:
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                          The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens

                          Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or

                          The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
                          frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and
                          maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or
                          sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more

                          The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some
                          patients
                          may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.
                          These
                          symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
                          develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                          disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
                          COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                          those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                          diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and
                          difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                          The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local,
                          tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
                          State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers
                          are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are
                          increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.

This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.

Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

                          Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                          respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                          COVID-19
                          associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                          your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout
                          the
                          day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the

                          but
                          this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

 is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name
 of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for 
 ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.

                People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

                Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
                
                Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.

                This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, '
                but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily
                 and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

              <div class="accordian mb-3"> 
                The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

                How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.
                
                Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:
                
                The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
                
                The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
                
                The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.
                
                Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
